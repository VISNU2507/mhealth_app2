Coaches can harness the power of DV Health to access athlete data, analyze performance metrics, and provide tailored guidance, ensuring athletes reach their peak performance. Welcome to a smarter way to train, compete, and succeed with DV Health.

## Key Features
- **Device Connectivity**: Seamlessly connect and manage fitness devices.
- **Athlete Management**: Organize and access athlete profiles.
- **Session Tracking**: Monitor and record various exercise sessions.
- **Health Data Analysis**: Gather and analyze heart rate data.

## Technical Details

### Main Components

#### Model
- `Device.dart`: This file defines the Device class, which encapsulates data and the status of a device. It includes methods to handle device connections and disconnections.
- `DeviceConnectionStatus.dart`: This file contains an enumeration DeviceConnectionStatus that represents different device connection states, such as "NOT_CONNECTED," "CONNECTING," and "CONNECTED."

#### View
- `athlete_list_page.dart`: This file defines the AthleteListPage widget, which displays a list of athletes. Each athlete is represented as an AthleteTile, and you can navigate to the login page for each athlete.
  
- `exercise_options_page.dart`: In this file, you'll find the ExerciseOption widget, which allows users to select exercise options based on the connected device. It also handles the start and end of workouts.
  
- `HR_data_page.dart`: This file defines the HRDataPage widget, which is intended to display heart rate data. However, it appears to be incomplete and doesn't contain specific functionality.
  
- `link_page.dart`: The LinkPage widget is defined in this file. It's a simple page with the title "Link" and a background color.
  
- `login_page.dart`: This file contains the LoginPage widget, which is used for user login. Users enter a PIN code, and if it matches the login code, they are navigated to the options page.
  
- `options_page.dart`: The OptionsPage widget is defined here. It serves as a central hub for navigating to different sections of the app, such as sessions, heart rate data, and links.
  
- `ScanWidget.dart`: This file defines the ScanWidget widget, which is responsible for scanning and connecting to devices. It lists available devices and allows users to start or stop scanning.

#### View_model
- `DeviceScanViewModel.dart`: The DeviceScanViewModel class manages the app's overall state, including the list of devices, scanning status, and device connections.
  
- `DeviceHRViewModel.dart`: Similar to DeviceScanViewModel, the DeviceHRViewModel.dart class manages data and state for a specific device, emphasizing heart rate data subscription and handling.

### Entry Point
- `main.dart`: The main.dart file serves as the entry point for the app. It defines the main MyApp widget, which initializes the app's theme and starts on the home page.


## Software and Libraries Used

### Flutter 3.13.3
- We used Flutter as the framework for developing the user interface and logic of our application.

### Flutter SDK 2.12.0
- This is the Software Development Kit for Flutter, which provides the necessary tools for Flutter app development.

### Dart 3.1.1
- Dart is the programming language used for building Flutter apps, and we have used version 3.1.1 of Dart.

### Windows 10
- Our development environment was based on Windows 10.

### Android Versions 9 and 10
- These were the target devices for our application, and our implementation was tested on Android 9 and 10.

### Supported Platforms
- Our application is designed to run on Android devices and Windows PCs.

### Movesense Library version 2.0.0
- We incorporated the Movesense library to generate signals and collect data from Movesense sensors.

### Permission Handler Library version 11.1.0
- The Permission Handler library was used to manage permissions required by the application.

### Python
- We also used Python as part of our implementation.

### Python Libraries - numpy and matplotlib
- These Python libraries were employed to visualize the 12-hour data collection process, helping us verify the correctness of data collection.

## Note

Please be aware that our system has not been tested on iOS devices. It is optimized and intended for use on Android and Windows platforms.

Thank you for using our software, and if you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to our support team.
